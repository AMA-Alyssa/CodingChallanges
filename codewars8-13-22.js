//Psuedo

// Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and
//  returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

// For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

// ["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

// Your function would return the following array:

// ["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

// All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths,
//  so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.

//P given an array of strings, each element will have a different legnth. Sort the array to shortest to longest
//R I will return the array back from shortest to longest
//E ['hi','hello', 'goodbye']
//P

function sortByLength (array) {
    // 
  };
