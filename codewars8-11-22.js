 //You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

//Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

//Assume the test input string is always a valid string. 
//For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.
//PREP
//parameters -> we are given a string and it will always have the number first in the string. It will always be positive and single digit
//Results -> the reult is a number
//Example -> the string says "6 years today" and I return 6
//Psuedo ->



function getAge(inputString){
    //seperate string and put in an array
    let seperateString = inputString.split(' ');
    //take the index of 0 of the that array
    //convert into an number
    //return number
    }
